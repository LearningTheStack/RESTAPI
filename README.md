# RESTAPI
## Creating a RESTful API with node.js

---

REST : REpresentational State Transfer

---

Traditionally:
Client(Browser) requests data from the Server.
Server responds with HTML files.

---

RESTful API:
-Client(Mobile App) stores and fetches data from a Server, but does not use or render HTML.
-Client(Code) wants to access third-party features such as Google Geolocation API.
-Client(Browser w/ SPA) stores and fetches data but never renders a second HTML page.

---

Using AJAX (asynchronous HTTP) requests, a RESTful API allows the transfer of data.

JSON, XML, URLEncoded, FormData, HTML ...
